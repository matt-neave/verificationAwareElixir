Abstract needs to be much stronger. Sell the achievements
- Doesnt mind a verbose report, but highlight the key factors. Use more italics and bold -- dont overuse them -- but use them to highlight the key phrases!  
- ITS GOOD THAT PRE AND POST CONDITIONS WORK AT RUNTIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ✅
- Remove all floyd-hoare logic with contract.. mention how floyd-hoare logic was an inspiration... ✅
- Use italics use italics use italics
- @v_entry => @init ✅ 
- give predicates names
- use contracts going forward instead of floyd-hoare and verified function ✅
- which big tools have been verified? CompSearch (C Compiler)
# Abstract
- not capturing the essence of whats in the project ✅
- promote the notion of distributed algorithms (prototyping..., replacing a specification modelling language with this framework.)  ✅
- Express using properties (safety, liveness) ✅
- Concurrent normally means shared memory=> distributed can highlight message passing
- want to be clear about making the claim on the LANGUAGE or the TOOL! which bit do you care about the most (naranker thinks the language, elixirv). say i touch nothing in the elixir program to make it verification aware - all we require is various bits of information. **Just use the one word (verlixir) for both.** Naranker thinks get rid of LTLixir naming, just run with verlixir. ✅
- "This project proposes and evaluates ElixirV," ✅

Chapter titles:
Verlixir / Design of Verlixir (4 and 5) could do with re-naming to help with the distinction. Some of the section titles are also more bland... be cooler (can use propose a question). Some best PHDs do: "the problem is the following...". 
example: "Why verification-aware languages?" -- then explain this paradigm of why interlinking is better than separate. 

Look at the wording: rigerous not vigerous!!!! ✅

It's overworded... between sequential nodes ... => sequential processes
# Introduction
- Why distributed ? because of the cloud based things. 
- Naranker lecture slides, lecture 1 have examples of 'why distributed?'. Need to consider these factors ontop of functional correctness
- 'Message passing can be more simple to reason about' -- find a reference. If someone asks me about it, need to be able to quote it.✅
- Don't need to give the description of Elixir in the introduction. ✅
- Instead, we want to introduce the project: "we are going to introduce a verification aware programming language for message passing". 
- Currently, too much information. Introduction can instead explicitly say the problem statement.  
- "We introduce Verlixir, an analysis tool"... is verlixir not actually a 'verification-aware language'. Don't flip between modes of phrasing. Just call verlixir a verificaiton-aware language. Even though it's elixir, we argue similar languages can be swapped out for elixir (i.e. Go, CSP). Clarity about what Verlixir is, keep the story around that. ✅
#### Objectives
- Think of goals in a much higher way. Capture the interesting and cool things. create a list of interesting things to talk about, pull from the list into the objectives. 🐿️
- Remove the stuff about GO from the introduction. (move them later on)! What ElixirV supports could be interesting in the objectives (highlighted as an overview) ✅
- If global shared memory is mentioned more than once, remove it (at least within a chapter).

#### Contributions
- Need to provide a sense of the challenges that are addressed. be direct / proud of the achievements... help express the problem space. 
- Not sure about the diagram... (just remove it)!  ✅


#### Background ✅
- Not sure why the CSP section is used. The notion of actors and message-passing is, but not the formal math.  ✅
- Could compare and contract shared memory and message passing styles (i.e. CSP to shared memory). ✅
- The formal math is never used. ✅
- Explain how Elixir and Go are inspired by CSP. ✅
- CSP should be mentioned, but not formally introduced? ✅
- CSP and Elixir are very different.  ✅
- Would rather focus on the title straight away... verification-awareness and actor based message passing.  ✅

- Solution is verification is typically model checking. But also proof assistants are a solution. . ✅
- Concurrency ok. LTL ok. Safety and liveness ok. Fairness ok. ✅

- 'By using both safety and liveness properties, we can define a 'correct' system, through the evaluation of these temporal formulae.' could go at the start too!! very important to the definition of distributed algorithms.

- Didnt explain what probabilistic and concurrent support mean in the model checking section. Explain before / after the table what they mean, why they are relevant.. why some systems care about them. Why the need and want them in wireless sensor networks for example ✅
- PRIMSM sub too short. Bulk it out ✅
- give an example of what PRISM and BLAST can give answers to ✅
-  random distributed algorithms WRONG => should say "randomised distributed algorithms" ✅
- Don't use X discovered Y... use formulate / create / designed ect.. ✅
- Forget about TLA, only mention TLA+.
- Say 'for example'!  
- instead of 2.3.2, give it a title (i.e. proof assistants) ✅
- Hoare logic: naranker doesnt understand. Remove hoare logic. My PRE and POST conditions dont really mean the same as his...   ✅
- **Could argue the notion of defv as a CONTRACT like in the CONTRACT PARADIGM! 'design by contract' is the name!, early languages use eiffel by bertrand meyer.** ✅
- Use 'related work' instead of 'existing work'. ✅
- Remove the examples of dafny, lean ect.  
- Dont bother with the forall quantifer.... get rid of the listings....

- Gomela deserves it's own section... move the introduction part on Gomela to it's own "related work" section.✅

- Add design by contract to related work too. Add more about proof assitants to related work. We can remove 'Additional Verication Techniques' and push proof assisants and contracts to related.   ✅

# Chapter 3
- Doesn't like the title.  ✅
- It's a primer on Elixir and Promela.✅
- Mention parts of Elixir that aren't supported? ✅
- Call the chapter **'Elixir and Promela'**✅
- Talk about unsupported features for both tools. (Liven some interest). ✅
- Add more to the Promela chapter. Talk about arrays ect... talk about things it has and I won't use. ✅
- Control flow example is not good. Give a concrete example instead of the half baked one. ✅
- Add else to the if statement. ✅
- Show a DO too. ✅
- Talk about how else is a negation of all the truths of the other ifs. ✅
- Put both side by side! (if and do) ✅
- Put !! and ?? in the chapter. ✅
- Add active proctypes, atomic (don't need their own sections) ✅
- Mention what parts have been built into promela and what parts are pure limitations. At the end mention the key limitations that I have extended! ✅

- Go through the language first and then the implementation? (PUSH 3.2.2 FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) ✅
- Swap the order of the 3.2.2 and the intro / 3.2.1!!! want language features!!!!!!!!!!!  ✅
- Mention extra unsupported features!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 ✅
- Node.spawn is not relevant???????? wtf (talk about the elixir toolchain) ✅
- **3.2.1 SHOULD be in the BACKGROUND!!!!!!!**  ✅
- If the elixir chapter becomes short, it could move into the subsequent chapter or the background chapter. ✅

- **Give the example of a promela program from the Promela manual. (Not one I care about)** ✅
- **Similar for Elixir, show an Elixir program (not one I care about) to give examples of what these things look like. (could put the client server one)... or one from a book / the website..... could show half a page example and mention a few things about it alongside some discussion.** 3/4s of a page for each example.
# Chapter 4

- Want to talk about ElixirV, the verification aware version.
- Too verbose.
- The verifiable feature set could appear in chapter 4... whereas chapter 3 covers more general elixir... 
- any programs written in this style,,, we can automatically detect deadlocks for ANY program with ONE line... free of charge! ✅
REstructure:
- mention the feature set ✅
- this is a useful feature set to build distributed algorithms ✅
- can capture all async communication, or free (Without doing anything) ✅
- go into the example with 3 clients and 1 server
- introduce both modes (simulation and verification) ✅
- feasible to do some simulation with randomness 
- 3 modes of operation for the tool.   ✅
- include all this in the introduction to the chapter, then build up the examples!!!!!! 
- By chapter 5,we should know everything...! 
- too verbose, cut down. ✅
- the simple examples can be short af 
- **SELL simulator mode!**
- SELL the MODES!! 
- explanations need a bit shortering
- **function types deserver their own section**!!!!!!!1 ✅
- **TYPES should be in the verifiable feature set!!!** ✅
- mention how types are a requirement  ✅
- **REMOVE THE ADD EXAMPLE**  ✅
- Wants to see the check\_clients code too! good example of recursion!
- Move types to own section( could go into the chapter 3, mention its a requirement)!!!!!!!!!!! mentioned theyre not used by the elixir compiler, but they are used by special tools like elixirV and dialyzer. ✅
- Remove the "generating trace"... or show "..." and "mention why the trace is omitted".  ✅
- predicate p => all\_alive  ✅
- predicate q STUPID GET RID OF IT ✅
- Show an example of a "quorum" predicate where "maj >= n / 2"
- add a post condition to show rounds decreasing instead of the dumb add function ✅
- put trace omitted ✅
- simplify the start\_client function, no need to assign LOL ✅
- **Put the deafult -p value in** to make it very clear ✅
- highlight the three modes... make the param version more interesting!!!!!!✅
- make the modes more explicit. Place in the evaluation the three modes of simulation /  ✅evaluation / parameteriation ✅
- @params => @model? ✅
- **Delete the acceptance confidence from the codebase.** ✅
- -p 2 ✅


# Chapter 5
- Sometimes wording was changed / heading was changes. some stuff referred to previous stuff ... sometimes things are repetititve... too much text ✅
- Just give intuition ✅
- Spec doesn't appear enough (i.e. is metaprogramming used?) ✅
-  bigger picture stuff is ok ✅
- design diagrams should use boxes for the components labelled arrows for information passing ✅
- "The" Elixir Compiler, Include the VaeLib in The Elixir Compiler. "Verlixir Translator". Label promela model, elixir program... Verlixir gets COMMAND LINE INPUTS / ELIXIR FILE / SPECIFICATION .... SPIN gets MY PROMELA LIBRARY / PROMELA CODE ...... ✅
- Label the SPIN MODEL CHECKER in diagram ✅
- diagrams should highlight the approach ✅

- Show less concrete side by sides of translations? ✅
- Can i add more diagrams / more fragments of code instead of lots of text ✅
- **DONT CALL THEM ATTRIBUTES. JUST NAME THEM.** ✅
- Think about it as a slidedeck! ✅
- The design needs to be woven in ✅
 - Need to explain where meta programming is used, where rust is used. ✅
- Split the flow: upto the promela generator, is most of the information.... we do all the metaprogramming / rust IR first... and then codegen into a separate chapter???????? ✅
- dont overelaborate on textual description ✅
- rename the pre and post- example as my own intermediate representation. ✅
- SHOW MORE OF THE PRE AND POST TURNSTILES FOR INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATION ✅
- dont show the intermediate representation ✅
- maybe put the pest into the appendix ✅
- dont explain what things are in chap5, ensure thats all done in chap4 ... ✅
- Move contracts (in the mapping table) up towards other functions haha ✅
- Remention what !! and ?? are in the table  ✅
- Restructure low level information -> highlight the key factor and then go more detail
- Combine 5.3.4 with previous entry ✅
- Simulation / verification 
- In the example in 4.5, show a better LTL example? use an exmaple where maj >= n/2 must always hold? (including renaming of p q r and s) 
- add \_\_ to all privates ✅
- Explain why !! and ?? in more detail ! ✅
- talk about weak fairness can be invoked / handled ✅
- just show examples of the fairness and the strongfairness 

# Evaluation
collect the examples, into a table to show what has been processed.
show promela and elixir for all in appendix. ✅
think of a good table / comparison for comparing the 5 algos
call raft, raft election instead of consensus  ✅
use 1 and 2 instead of one and two  ✅
evaluate all 3 modes of operation 

put performance before translation ✅

not translation reults => comparison! ✅

---forward---  optimisations ✅


# Conclusion
Repeat everything we aimed to achieve in the conclusions(dont just reference them) ✅

Lots of stuff in conclusions... reference everything we aimed to do, what we have done ect.!! ✅


APPENDIX FOR EACH ALGORITHM!


# TODOs
Replace all Floyd-Hoare style => contracts ✅
name predicates everywhere  ✅
elixir chapter 
intro frontends 
	talk about the match operator in detail in the Elixir section ✅  
naranker doesnt like "Design of verlixir"✅
