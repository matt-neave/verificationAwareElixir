\chapter{Introduction}
With the rise of cloud-based clusters, developing robust distributed algorithms is becoming an increasingly difficult problem and the need for vigorous methodologies to verify the correctness of these algorithms has intensified. Modern programming languages have been developed to support distributed algorithms that rely on message-passing as a means of communication between sequential nodes executing in parallel. Common message-passing abstractions involve the use of processes (e.g. Go \cite{go}) or actors \cite{actor} (e.g. Erlang \cite{erlang}). Message-passing abstractions are simpler to reason about than a common alternative in shared-memory concurrency, however, it becomes more difficult to verify a program implements a given specification.

Elixir \cite{elixir} is a functional programming language built on top of Erlang that runs on the BEAM virtual machine \cite{beam}. It is commonly used for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications because it supports concurrency, communication and distribution. Elixir actors are uniquely identified with a process identifier (pid) and own an unbounded mailbox. Each mailbox supports communication between actors, one actor can send a message to another actor's mailbox, which is then enqueued and can be received in a First-In-First-Firable-Out (FIFFO) ordering. FIFFO is similar to First-In-First-Out (FIFO) where elements are dequeued in the order they are enqueued, however, Elixir supports receiving messages with pattern-matching such that messages are received in a FIFO order concerning a pattern.

This paper discusses the automatic modelling of actor-based programs and the verification of their adherence to a specification, using Elixir as a target language to support the verification of real-world systems.
